                    <p>
                        Mr Matthew Barry is contracted to work 48 hours per week for the National Health Service. For the remainder of the week, he has chosen to spend his time seeing and treating patients privately. He works as an independent private medical practitioner and is not contracted to provide care by any one insurance company or hospital.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        He is happy to see patients who choose to pay for their own treatment, insured patients or patients with co-payment insurance. All patients are charged the same fees, irrespective of whether they pay themselves or have insurance to help meet the costs.

                    <p>
                        Fees for surgery depend on the nature and complexity of the operation and there may be a difference between Mr Barry’s fees and what the insurance company will pay and any difference (the shortfall) will be payable by the patient.   
                        <br><br>
                        Patients are recommended to check their insurance policy prior to proceeding with any treatment offered to verify the level to which they are covered under their own private medical insurance scheme, and to check the amount of any excess payment they will need to supplement personally under the terms of their policy.

                    <h1>Procedure</h1>
                    <p>
                        Should you require surgery, Mr Barry’s secretary will contact you by letter and provide:
                    </p>    
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The name of the operation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The operation code
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Your anticipated length of stay in hospital
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Mr Barry’s surgical fees
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        It is VERY important to understand that Mr Barry’s fees are for his time and expertise. There will be the anaesthetist’s fees and the hospital charges in addition.
                        <br><br>
                        Mr Barry is always transparent with his fees - his fees represent a fair and reasonable price for his time and expertise and are in line with colleagues of equal stature and experience. As explained above, there may be a difference between Mr Barry’s fees and what the insurance company will pay and any difference (the shortfall) will be payable by the patient and payment may be taken in advance of the surgery.
